      -- in a shell:
      --
      --   * lldb --batch -o 'help command script import'
      --   * lldb --batch -o 'help command source'

      -- debugger console if the command succeeds).
      --

      -- prefixed with `!` fails, subsequent commands will not be run).

      -- config file instead, which would enable rust types globally for ALL
      -- lldb sessions (i.e. including those run outside of nvim). However,
      -- that may lead to conflicts when debugging other languages, as the type
      -- formatters are merely regex-matched against type names. Also note that
      -- .lldbinit doesn't support the `!` and `?` prefix shorthands.
